# 1. Updates
Step one of using a new Computer is always checking for updates, after a time updates can make your computer slower but they are meant to make your computer safe for you and to protect you from getting hacked so PLEASE INSTALL UPDATES. Your computer can restart multiple times during this and it may be annoying but still, first update everything. Go through every update and wait until it reads something like: "your computer is up-to date!".
